# MULTIPLAYER TICTACTOE
This repository contains my Multiplayer TicTacToe project.

* Have used express and socket.io to create the backend.
* Used socket.io to instantiate Web Socket communication to pass info between players in real-time.
* Uses Socket IDs to identify players.
* Has client-side Game management with only actions being communicated. This facilitates offline Play-with-a-Friend.

## Index

- This has a very basic front end. It is written purely in HTML JS and CSS due to my inaquaintance with front-end frameworks by the time I started building this.
